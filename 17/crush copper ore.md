## From Ore to Finished Product
Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. And as alloyed in bronze (copper-tin alloy) about 3000 BC, was the first engineering material known to man.

Specific Gravity Of General Materials Table. Temperature and purity will often have a definite effect. As 1000kg of pure water @ 4°C = 1 cubic meter, those materials under 1000kg per cubic meter will float; more dense materials will obviously sink. Those materials have a specific gravity more than 1.

## How Are Diamonds Mined And Extracted From the Ground
Alluvial Diamond Mining. Alluvial mining involves the building of walls and the diversion of rivers. Once the water is emptied out and prevented from flowing into the area of interest, bulldozers can now be used to exploit the ground of the riverbank. Usually, kimberlite ore can be found in depths of at least 15 meters.
