Byproduct mining is related to hard rock mining in that open pit or underground mining tunnels are used. In byproduct mining, gold is a secondary find. The main purpose of the mining operation is the recovery of Copper, sand, gravel or other products but significant quantities of Gold exist to make byproduct mining a profitable venture.

## What Is Gold Mining? How Is Gold Mined?
Hard rock gold mining extracts gold in rock instead of fragments in loose sediment, producing most of the gold in the world. Open-pit mining is sometimes used, for example in central Alaska's Fort Knox Mine. Barrick Gold Corporation has one of the largest open-pit gold mines in North America located on its Goldstrike mine property in north

## Hydraulic mining
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.. Hydraulic mining originated out of ancient Roman techniques that used water to excavate soft underground

## What Are Some Methods of Gold Mining? | Reference
Hard rock mining, placer mining, by-product mining and gold ore processing are some methods of gold mining. Each method has its unique process of accessing, extracting and processing gold. Hard rock mining is a method that involves the creation of underground tunnels or open pit mines to access gold in a surrounding rock.

It was underground, hard-rock mining operations that transformed California gold mining into a corporate activity. It was in the Northern Mines, clustered around Grass Valley, which dominated underground mining. In the beginning, the gold-bearing quartz was wrenched from underground veins by backbreaking, dimly lit sweat and blood.
